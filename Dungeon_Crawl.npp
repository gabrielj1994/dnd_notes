Story:
	Born into a family of the nobility. Raised for a life of postilating and political maneuvering. Leon had a natural talent for seeing through people. He despised living inside this world of masks and falsehoods. And so he rejected it, the only way a child could, through mischief. [add more here]
	
	[At some point he goes too far, ruins one political game too many.] To save face, his father is forced to send him away. Publicly, Leon was leaving "to go see the world", but really he was being banished without all the controversy and scandal that would surely result if it was official.

	Altar of the Lupine Lords
	Jewel on black velvet, pearl in the sea
	Unchanged but eâ€™erchanging, eternally
	
Limericks
	my life almost ended
	heart was stopped cold
	but 
	my wounds were mended
	
	There was a young fellow named Feng,
Who hadn't an inch of a wang.
He indulged a desire,
To touch a live fire,
And he celebrated by drinking beer.
	
Rhymes
	with a spring and a step
	he jumped and leapt
