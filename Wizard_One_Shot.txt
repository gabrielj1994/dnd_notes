You have all heard the famous tale, from a traveling bard, drunk beggar or an old cleric. Once it was
bigger than a mountain, once it was sent by the gods themselves. Sometimes the tale told of a
terrifying... thing... that spat flames, and at others of a great evil that demanded human sacrifices. One
time a story even described things that were too horrifying to talk about, but usually they just said that
it slaughters most of the townsfolk.
Only one detail was consistent in all the varying stories, one thing that everyone agreed on. The
reward! A reward at request sing the bards, a wish to order speak the rumors. And so you have come to
the city of Majentic, whose name has been spreading in the winds over the past year. According to the
tales, the governor of the city, Lordan ironwolf, has promised any prize you demand. You are not fools,
so you know that you cannot expect to get any prize you wish for, but you are sure you will get a sizable
reward nonetheless.
So, like many others, you have come to face the terror of the machine. Some of you came to the city to
save it and earn honor and praise, some of you came for the money involved, and a few of you are just
here for the challenge.
