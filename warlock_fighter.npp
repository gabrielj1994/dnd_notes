Full name: Razasheir Ceronius Seleuciant First of His Name

Born to the noble house Seleucian in the city of Halistakar, Razasheir should have led a privileged life wanting of nothing. However, it was not in the stars. The Seleucian household was a bloodline of gifted exorcists, who made their name known across the land by tackling the contracts no one would accept. This marked the lineage as enemies to the undying forces of evil that they banished to the Nine Hells and Abyss. One such entity sought not the exact revenge on the past generations that wronged it, but rather on their future. It sacrificed its own life force to place a powerful curse on the next bloodline heir, Razasheir. As a result, for a hundred and one years, Razasheir would only know suffering. Within the holy confines of the Seleucian estate, his curse reacted like a blight upon his skin, scarring his left arm as if submit to hellfire. Additionally, the longer he stayed within the household, the weaker its wards became. Shortly after Razasheir came to the age of maturity, he made the decision to leave his family behind, as he was a liability to them and eventually all of Halistakar. It has been 20 years since, and Razasheir wanders the countryside in search of work and adventure, chasing down any lead that might prove useful in cleansing the curse, or at least stop its spread. Although he keeps his family name hidden, Raza upholds the family tradition of vanquishing evil entities. For any village he comes across in his travels, he takes on any rumors of haunted forest groves, demonic basement cults, or local graveyard necromancy. All this just in exchange for food and shelter.

Now Raza hears rumors of a far-away land, with new possibilities. This piques his interest, as his travels so far have made no headway regarding the spread of his curse. He now sets forth for the Mages' Guild and whatever expedition they have planned, in the hopes that something in these mysterious lands will be of some assistance
