Hook:
You are in the Black Gate district of Baldur's Gate. You need to head north to Waterdeep following a lead on the orphans.  You can chose to do so either as a travler or a guard. You have been directed by locals to a wagon maker named Ackyn. (In your backstory, if okay, lets make the raiders mercenaries and cultists. Works well with campaign.)

Party dealings before I come in:
they are on the trail of the dragon hoard, looking to pose as caravan hands in the caravan that may contain the hoard
Winterwind and Rafael go into an inn
Emori looking for info in the shops

					we tell them about the weird figure with book
						ratai reacts to "Duly Noted"
							invites us to the headquarters of the flaming fist
FLAMING FIST HQ
	lore:
		Merc grp hired to bolster city guard and city defenses
		neutral police force

		attended by sceneschals
		ratai comes into room, has a book with him
			book looks like the one the figure had
				tells us of an ancient sect in baldur's gate. to the god of murder

		GATE DISTRICT
			makan and markus go there. the warehousy part of baldur's gate.
			scope out the house winterwind saw the figure on top of.
			there are more official looking people in this building
			beggar:
				trade house
				the contraband criminals go here
				security increased since the lords of waterdeep
			makan goes to the guards at the door
				startles the fuck out of the guard
				asks where he can get hired to 
					there is a taskmaster
					passing some notes around
			building
				1st floor bigger
				portcullis extends entryway around all four sides
				very large stone structures that support this building
				the first floor is not a warehouse, they go down to something beneath
				at the back there is some official and well dressed going up.
				there are a fair number of windows
				four or five stories more but no windows
				parapets to prevent landing there, at the top is where winterwind saw the figure
				reason for all this is a means of security. whatever is on the upper levels is so important that it has been secured to this extent. precautions to prevent theft.
			Makan
				friend guard: francois
				didn't use to be like this.
				there used to be an open area
					influx of trade from the port

				then emori lies to him, so even more concerned
			sophia lets out that it is about the resurgence of bhaal
				he notes that the subject will upset her.
			first two stories are clean but modest
			third story is opulent
			her bedroom overlooks the city and some gardens
				she is delusional
				thinks the players are ambassodars or something.
				she is fully clothed, high neck on top of her corset
					even has clothes on
				recounting the events
					she dissociated most of the memories (gore as decor)
					she doesn't answer about what happened to thadius(?)
					doesn't answer about the father of her son
					she speaks of a son she should have no knowledge of
						the records indicate she never had contact with him
						pretty sure she was raped by the bhaal guy
							child was the result of that
					winterwind and morgan push too far
						her composure breaks, second personality breaks through
							insane, savage, brutal
						keeps repeating "carmandis"
						marshal calms her with a spell
							tells us the ring is a gift from the son's father
							there is an item that was delivered to her a few years ago
